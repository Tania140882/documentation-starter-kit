## Question 3
Describe how you solved a challenge or technical issue that you faced in a previous role
(preferably in a previous support role). How did you determine that your solution was
successful?


### Response

**Situation** : Multiple deliveries for production while testing it out in lab in Sandvine. One of feature to be tested and delivered was the Intelligent Traffic Shaping (i.e closed loop monitoring system which shaped traffic based on usage and bandwidth availability)

**Task**: My task was to assist in setting up the lab environment and providing all necessary help and guidance to the team by involving the right stakeholders in this case Engineering. We chalked out a plan based on deadlines, resource availability, and the potential impact on our overall goals. Somehow we underestimated the feature and it's complexity and slipped the delivery date.

I took immediate action to address the issue. I called for a retrospective meeting of the engineering and solution team where we analyzed what went wrong and why. We identified that our initial assessment lacked a thorough analysis of the uniquenss of NBN network and underestimated the testing time.

**Result**: We arrived at a flexible approach, allowing for regular check-ins and working in collaboration to test the functionality out. Adjustments were made based on progress and new information.


## Question 4
When would you choose to use Edge Functions, Serverless Functions, or Edge Middleware with Vercel?


### Response:
**Edge Functions**: Use for low-latency, globally distributed tasks that require dynamic content generation or modification at the edge.


**Serverless Functions**: Use for backend processing tasks, complex operations, and when you need on-demand execution of functions triggered by events.


**Edge Middleware**: Use for intercepting and modifying requests, implementing routing logic, enforcing access controls, and adding security measures at the edge.

## Question  5
Imagine a customer writes in requesting help with a build issue on a framework or technology that you've not seen before. How would you begin troubleshooting this and what questions would you ask he customer to understand the situation better?


### Response:
**First Step**:
Acknowledge the mail and Gather Initial Information to understand the context of the issue.

* Will ask the customer to share the detail description of the issue seen.
* What operating system and version they are using?
* What version of the framework or technology are you using?
* Any specific error message?
* Will ask if they can provide details about your development environment: config files, portion of code.
* logs to share or screenshot of the issue.
* Any changes done to system before the running into the problem?

**Second Step**:
* Research the Framework: Setup guide, configuration guide,knowledge-base, Jira issues.
* Try and reproduce the issue on local setup with the same system configuration and code provided by customer.
* Identify the scope of issue: Whether it is build or an upgrade issue, configuration issue, enviroment issue after upgrade to isolate the problem.
* Reach out to peers in teams to check if a similar issue was seen in past, someone more experienced in handling the Framework.

**Third Step**:
* Get back to customer suggesting config modification.
* Suggesting patch upgrade or software upgrade based on situation.
* Follow-up on the suggestion and guide them if needed.

Finally if solved, get the confirmation from the Customer and document the issue and Troubleshooting steps and put it in knowledge base.


## Question  6
The customer from question 5 replies to your response with the below:

## Question  7
A customer writes in to the Helpdesk asking "How do I do a redirect from the /blog path
to https://example.com?" Please write a reply to the customer. Feel free to add any
information about your decision making process after the reply.

### Response:
Hi [CustomerName],

Thank you for reaching out to us!

To redirect the /blog path to another URL, you can utilize the Vercel configuration file (vercel.json) to set up the necessary redirects. 
Steps to achieve this:

* Create or update your vercel.json file in the root directory of your project.

Add a "routes" property to specify the redirects. Below is an example configuration:
```
{
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/blog", "status": 301, "headers": { "Location": "https://example.com" } }
  ]
}
```
Save the changes to your vercel.json file and deployed your project to Vercel. 

Accessing the /blog path should automatically redirect visitors to https://example.com cause of http redirect status code 301.

If you have any further questions or need assistance with anything else, feel free to reach out to us anytime. We're here to help!

Best regards,

Tania

> **Note** : Decision was done based on the theory that the Customer is using Vercel framework to deply their Project. The configuration file (\*.json) is to set up the redirect because it's a straightforward  way to handle redirects for Vercel projects.

## Question  8
A customer is creating a site and would like their project not to be indexed by search
engines. Please write a reply to the customer. Feel free to add any information about
your decision making process after the reply.

### Response:
Hi [CustomerName],

Thank you for reaching out to us. I understand that you would like your project not to be indexed by search engines. While we can certainly help you achieve this, it's important to consider the implications.

Implications of Not Indexing Your Project:
This as you know would reduced discoverability through Search engines and it will not list your site in search results.
Also to keep in mind, you will miss out on organic traffic that comes from search engine results, potentially reducing the number of visitors to your site.
If you ever change your mind and decide to index your site in the future, it may take some time for search engines to crawl and index your site, delaying your Search Enginer optimization efforts.

Steps to Prevent Search Engine Indexing:
To ensure your project is not indexed by search engines, you can follow these steps:

a) robots.txt File:

Create or edit a robots.txt file in the root directory of your site.
Add the following lines to the robots.txt file to disallow all search engine crawlers:
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
```
b) Meta Tags:

Add the following meta tag to the head section of each HTML page that you do not want to be indexed:
```
<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">
```
c) Noindex Header:

If you have control over your server configuration, you can set the ```X-Robots-TaG``` HTTP header to noindex for the pages you want to exclude.
Here is a link to our detailed documentation that provides step-by-step instructions for each method.

Please let me know if you need further assistance or if you have any other questions. I'm here to help!

Best regards

Tania

> **Note** : Decision Making was done based on the customer’s request to prevent their project from being indexed by search engines. This might indicate their need for privacy or control over who can discover their content.

****Additional Information for the decision taken:****

* robots.txt File: This file gives instructions to web crawlers about which pages or files the crawler can or cannot request from the website. While most well-behaved search engine bots follow these instructions, it's not a foolproof method.

* Meta Tags: Adding meta tags is a reliable method to instruct search engines not to index specific pages. This method ensures that individual pages are excluded from search results.

* Noindex Header: This is an HTTP header response directive that can be used to prevent indexing. This method is useful for dynamically generated pages where adding a meta tag might not be feasible.


## Question 9 
What do you think is one of the most common problems which customers ask Vercel for help with? How would you help customers to overcome common problems, short-term
and long-term?

Most common issue for Vercel customer could be build failure (as suggested in Question 5 above) or Integration issue with third party services

**Short-Term Solutions could be**

Identify the Issue:
* Gather Details by asking the customer for specific error messages, logs, and the steps they took before encountering the issue.
* Check Documentation by directing the customer to relevant documentation or guides that address common deployment problems.

Provide Assistance:
* Offer to guide the customer through the debugging process in screen share mode. 

Walkthrough Debugging: 
* This might involve checking their build configuration, ensuring that environment variables are set correctly, and verifying that all required services are running.
