## Question 3
Describe how you solved a challenge or technical issue that you faced in a previous role
(preferably in a previous support role). How did you determine that your solution was
successful?


### Response

**Situation** : Multiple deliveries for production while testing it out in lab in Sandvine. One of feature to be tested and delivered was the Intelligent Traffic Shaping (i.e closed loop monitoring system which shaped traffic based on usage and bandwidth availability)

**Task**: My task was to assist in setting up the lab environment and providing all necessary help and guidance to the team by involving the right stakeholders in this case Engineering. We chalked out a plan based on deadlines, resource availability, and the potential impact on our overall goals. Somehow we underestimated the feature and it's complexity and slipped the delivery date.

I took immediate action to address the issue. I called for a retrospective meeting of the engineering and solution team where we analyzed what went wrong and why. We identified that our initial assessment lacked a thorough analysis of the uniquenss of NBN network and underestimated the testing time.

**Result**: We arrived at a flexible approach, allowing for regular check-ins and working in collaboration to test the functionality out. Adjustments were made based on progress and new information.


## Question 4
When would you choose to use Edge Functions, Serverless Functions, or Edge Middleware with Vercel?


### Response:
**Edge Functions**: Use for low-latency, globally distributed tasks that require dynamic content generation or modification at the edge.


**Serverless Functions**: Use for backend processing tasks, complex operations, and when you need on-demand execution of functions triggered by events.


**Edge Middleware**: Use for intercepting and modifying requests, implementing routing logic, enforcing access controls, and adding security measures at the edge.

## Question  5
Imagine a customer writes in requesting help with a build issue on a framework or technology that you've not seen before. How would you begin troubleshooting this and what questions would you ask he customer to understand the situation better?


### Response:
**First Step**:
Acknowledge the mail and Gather Initial Information to understand the context of the issue.

* Will ask the customer to share the detail description of the issue seen.
* What operating system and version they are using?
* What version of the framework or technology are you using?
* Any specific error message?
* Will ask if they can provide details about your development environment: config files, portion of code.
* logs to share or screenshot of the issue.
* Any changes done to system before the running into the problem?

**Second Step**:
* Research the Framework: Setup guide, configuration guide,knowledge-base, Jira issues.
* Try and reproduce the issue on local setup with the same system configuration and code provided by customer.
* Identify the scope of issue: Whether it is build or an upgrade issue, configuration issue, enviroment issue after upgrade to isolate the problem.
* Reach out to peers in teams to check if a similar issue was seen in past, someone more experienced in handling the Framework.

**Third Step**:
* Get back to customer suggesting config modification.
* Suggesting patch upgrade or software upgrade based on situation.
* Follow-up on the suggestion and guide them if needed.

Finally if solved, get the confirmation from the Customer and document the issue and Troubleshooting steps and put it in knowledge base.


## Question  6
The customer from question 5 replies to your response with the below:
“I’m so frustrated. I’ve been trying to make this work for hours and I just can’t figure it
