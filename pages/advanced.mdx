## Question 3
Describe how you solved a challenge or technical issue that you faced in a previous role
(preferably in a previous support role). How did you determine that your solution was
successful?


### Response

**Situation** : Multiple deliveries for production while testing it out in lab in Sandvine. One of feature to be tested and delivered was the Intelligent Traffic Shaping (i.e closed loop monitoring system which shaped traffic based on usage and bandwidth availability)

**Task**: My task was to assist in setting up the lab environment and providing all necessary help and guidance to the team by involving the right stakeholders in this case Engineering. We chalked out a plan based on deadlines, resource availability, and the potential impact on our overall goals. Somehow we underestimated the feature and it's complexity and slipped the delivery date.

I took immediate action to address the issue. I called for a retrospective meeting of the engineering and solution team where we analyzed what went wrong and why. We identified that our initial assessment lacked a thorough analysis of the uniquenss of NBN network and underestimated the testing time.

**Result**: We arrived at a flexible approach, allowing for regular check-ins and working in collaboration to test the functionality out. Adjustments were made based on progress and new information.


## Question 4
When would you choose to use Edge Functions, Serverless Functions, or Edge Middleware with Vercel?


### Response:
**Edge Functions**: Use for low-latency, globally distributed tasks that require dynamic content generation or modification at the edge.


**Serverless Functions**: Use for backend processing tasks, complex operations, and when you need on-demand execution of functions triggered by events.


**Edge Middleware**: Use for intercepting and modifying requests, implementing routing logic, enforcing access controls, and adding security measures at the edge.
